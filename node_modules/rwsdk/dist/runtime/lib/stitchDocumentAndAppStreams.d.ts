/**
 * A utility to orchestrate and interleave two ReadableStreams (a document shell and an app shell)
 * based on a set of markers within their content. This is designed to solve a specific
 * race condition in streaming Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Suspense.
 *
 * The logic is as follows:
 * 1. Stream the document until a start marker is found.
 * 2. Switch to the app stream and stream it until an end marker is found. This is the non-suspended shell.
 * 3. Switch back to the document stream and stream it until the closing body tag. This sends the client script.
 * 4. Switch back to the app stream and stream the remainder (the suspended content).
 * 5. Switch back to the document stream and stream the remainder (closing body and html tags).
 *
 * @param outerHtml The stream for the document shell (`<Document>`).
 * @param innerHtml The stream for the application's content.
 * @param startMarker The marker in the document to start injecting the app.
 * @param endMarker The marker in the app stream that signals the end of the initial, non-suspended render.
